## IntroText
Greetings, fleshlings![AN]
In early 2016, Ghaststation hosted the[N]
first iteration of Make a Fun Chapter.[AN]
It was a contest whose goal was to piss[N]
off the player as much as humanly possi--[N]
oops,[.4] hang on,[.4] I'm thinking of Ragefest.[AN]
Actually,[.4] I think you can probably figure[N]
out the actual goal.[.4] Anyway, one of the[AN]
submissions,[.4] FE Tower Defense,[.4] made by[N]
PwnageKirby,[.4] was a rather innovative hack.[AN]
Unfortunately for us,[.4] it was made in FEXNA[N]
and wasn't going to be publically released.[AN]
After seeing the submission being played,[N]
I was inspired to recreate the game as a[N]
FE8 hack and thus allow others to play it.[AN]
This has turned out to take far longer[N]
than expected (business as usual, right?),[N]
and the original is actually playable now[AN]
(search for "Tower Defense" in the Fan[N]
Projects section of SerenesForest forums).[AN]
This version isn't finished,[.4] but I[N]
thought it had enough to be played.[AN]
It's been an adventure to make this hack;[AN]
some good,[.4] some bad[.4], an awful lot of[N]
tedium...[.4] but I think the end result is[N]
worth it.[.4] I hope you enjoy playing it.[AN]
Yours sincerely,[N]
The Management (aka Tequila)[A][X]

## AnnaSpeaks1
[oml][Anna]
Hi there![.4] Welcome to FETD MK II.[.4] I'm[N]
Anna,[.4] and I'll be helping you out.[A][X]

## AnnaSpeaks3
[oml][Anna]
Is this your first time playing?[N]
[Yes][X]

## FirstTimeYes
[oml][Anna]
Alright,[.4] I've enabled the tutorial.[.4] I'll[N]
be explaining things to you as we go along.[AN]
In the future,[.4] you'll be able to consult[N]
the guide for a refresher,[.4] but for now[AN]
you'll just have to remember everything.[A][X]

## FirstTimeNo
[oml][Anna]
Ok![.4] Tutorial mode has been disabled.[AN]
In the future, you'll be able to refer[N]
to the guide to refresh your memory,[AN]
but it's not currently implemented.[A][X]

## AnnaSpeaks2
[oml][Anna]
The story so far is that this chap in[N]
the corner,[.4] Duke Syting of Aliquet,[AN]
has contracted me to save him from[N]
the horde that will be appearing soon.[AN]
I don't remember why, but it doesn't[N]
really matter.[.4] All that matters is[AN]
that I'm getting paid, and you are[N]
going to help me achieve that goal.[AN]
Well,[.4] there's no time to lose.[.4] Let's go![A][X]

## Tutorial1
[oml][Anna]
The horde is surprisingly well-mannered[N]
and will not attack all at once.[AN]
Instead, they will come in waves,[.4][N]
spawning at various points on the map.[AN]
Blocking the spawn points will not work.[AN]
Once a wave has appeared,[.4] they will make[N]
their way to the Duke and attempt to[AN]
politely cave his skull in.[.4] Your job is[N]
to prevent this from happening by[AN]
spawning your own units.[.4] This,[.4] of course,[N]
costs money,[.4] which[Silent...]we don't have.[.4] Hmm.[AN]
I think some negotiations are in order.[A][X]

## Tutorial2
[oml][Anna]
The Duke has kindly given us an advance,[.4] so[N]
we'll be able to hire some units of our own.[AN]
To do so,[.4] simply place the cursor on an[N]
empty tile (no units or walls) and press A.[AN]
Select 'Buy' to open the purchasing menu.[AN]
When a unit is purchased,[.4] you can move it to[N]
where it needs to be.[A] Once an action is taken[N]
(or the turn is ended),[.4] most units will be[AN]
locked in place and unable to move again, so[N]
be careful when placing a unit![A][X]

## Tutorial3
[omr][Anna]
Look![.4] A wave has spawned.[.4] Nothing too[N]
threatening yet,[.4] but that will change.[AN]
Enemies will move towards the Duke,[.4][N]
provided there is an open path.[AN]
If there isn't,[.4] however,[.4] they will[N]
try to attack anything in range![AN]
The goal box shows when the next wave[N]
will spawn,[.4] but not where,[.4] so watch out![A][X]

## Tutorial4
[oml][Anna]
In FETD,[.4] cash is king,[.4] queen,[.4] prince[N]
regent,[.4] and archbishop of the Church[AN]
of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.[AN]
Your current gold can be found in the[N]
goal window.[.4] It will gradually increase[AN]
each day as you get a small stipend[N]
from the Duke's coffers,[.4] but that alone[AN]
won't be enough to fund your army.[AN]
The bulk of your money will come from[N]
defeating enemies.[.4] To find out a unit's[AN]
"worth", check the stat screen where[N]
Affinity used to be.[AN]
Note: the weapon triangle bonuses have[N]
been increased to +/- 25 hit/3 damage.[AN]
Bear this in mind when figuring out[N]
what unit classes to purchase.[A][X]

## Tutorial5
[oml][Anna]
When you buy a unit,[.4] a random[N]
character is then picked as well.[AN]
There are 100 different characters,[.4][N]
and each comes with a unique[AN]
combination of personal skill,[.4][N]
base modifiers,[.4] and growth modifiers.[AN]
The latter two are added to class[N]
bases and class growths,[.4] respectively.[AN]
This means that two units of the[N]
same class won't necessarily level[AN]
up in the same way,[.4] but I think[N]
that's part of the fun![AN]
You can check growths by pressing[N]
Select on the stat screen.[A][X]

## Tutorial6
[oml][Anna]
There may come a time when a unit[N]
you placed simply isn't working out.[AN]
You can remove them by selecting[N]
'Remove' from the unit action menu.[A][X]

## Tutorial7
[omr][Anna]
Units aren't the only thing that you[N]
can buy. In the northwest corner,[AN]
my sisters have decided to set up shop.[AN]
Use your merchant to visit the shops[N]
(don't worry,[.4] he doesn't get greyed out),[AN]
where you can buy weapons,[.4] staffs,[.4][N]
items,[.4] and more![.4] Some of the shops[AN]
aren't accessible right now because[N]
their proprietor has stepped out for[AN]
any number of reasons and will return[N]
eventually,[.4] but perhaps they can be[AN]
bribed to open up a little quicker[Silent...][A][X]

## Tutorial8
[oml][Anna]
Some items have had their[N]
characteristics changed[AN]
from their vanilla FE8[N]
versions.[.4] Use that R button![A][X]

## Tutorial9
[oml][Anna]
It may be worth talking to me,[.4] if you[N]
haven't already.[.4] Bring your wallet.[A][X]

## Tutorial10
[oml][Anna]
Selling items that you obtain may[N]
be tempting,[.4] but my sisters and I[AN]
are super stingy and will only[N]
give you 25% of an item's worth.[AN]
It might be better to hang onto[N]
and use those items yourself.[A][X]

## Tutorial11
[oml][Anna]
Did you notice that almost all units[N]
can access the Supply command?[AN]
That means you can freely trade weapons[N]
and items between units across the map.[AN]
How does it work?[.4] I haven't the[N]
faintest idea;[.4] I heard something about[AN]
pocket dimensions and kinda tuned out[Silent...][A][X]

## Tutorial12
[oml][Anna]
Remember how I told you that units can't[N]
move after taking their first action?[AN]
Well,[.4] that's mostly true.[.4] My sister Ana[N]
sells an item called Relocate,[.4] which can[AN]
be used to move a unit somewhere else.[AN]
Also,[.4] classes with the Passable skill,[N]
such as thieves,[.4] are always allowed to[AN]
move a short distance,[.4] but at the[N]
expense of not being able to block enemies.[A][X]

## Tutorial13
[oml][Anna]
Have you bought a dancer yet?[.4] They're[N]
expensive,[.4] but the Dance ability has[AN]
been upgraded;[.4] it will now refresh all[N]
adjacent units at once.[.4] Neat, huh?[AN]
They also come with a random ring,[.4][N]
which buffs a single target and[AN]
refreshes them at the same time.[A][X]

## Tutorial14
[oml][Anna]
Thieves are sneaky little buggers,[.4][N]
and they can steal stuff in addition[AN]
to not being entirely locked in place.[AN]
If promoted to Rogue,[.4] they can steal[N]
even more stuff, like unequipped weapons.[A][X]

## Tutorial15
[oml][Anna]
Do you want to promote your units?[AN]
My sister Nan sells Master Seals,[.4][N]
but you can also promote a level 20[AN]
unit for free by selecting 'Promote'[N]
from the unit action menu.[AN]
The promotion options are the same[N]
either way,[.4] and some of the choices[AN]
aren't offered in the purchasing menu.[A][X]

## Tutorial16
[oml][Anna]
Summoners are a versatile unit that can[N]
either heal or attack,[.4] depending on what[AN]
class they promoted from,[.4] but both[N]
versions can summon phantoms to the field.[AN]
A phantom comes with a random weapon[N]
and cannot trade or use Supply,[.4] but[AN]
they're great options for chipping away[N]
at tough opponents.[.4] There can be up to[AN]
5 phantoms active at one time between[N]
all summoners on the field.[A][X]

## Tutorial17
[omr][Anna]
Oh![.4] A boss just spawned.[.4] These are[N]
stronger than their normal counterparts,[AN]
but they offer more exp, more gold,[N]
and a nice droppable item to compensate.[A][X]

## Tutorial18
[omr][Anna]
Uh oh.[.4] The unit that just spawned[N]
has a skull insignia;[.4] which[AN]
indicates they're an assassin.[AN]
Assassins will attack your troops[N]
with no provocation,[.4] seeking to[AN]
break holes in your lines for[N]
the rest of the horde to slip[AN]
through.[.4] You'd best take them[N]
out with extreme prejudice.[A][X]

## NanTalk
[oml][Anna]
Ahh,[.4] it's not much fun,[.4] always[N]
being cooped up in the shop.[AN]
It's nice to have some fresh air.[AN]
Oh?[.4] You want me to go back in before[N]
[Red]turn 15[Red]?[.4] Fine,[.4] but you have to pay[AN]
[Red]300 gold[Red] for me to go back to work.[A][X]

## AnnTalk
[oml][Anna]
Look,[.4] I'm trying to contact the[N]
spirit of my departed grandmother.[AN]
Your presence isn't helping.[AN]
What?[.4] You want me to open up[N]
the shop before [Red]turn 30[Red]?[AN]
I'll have to ask for [Red]1000 gold[Red].[A][X]

## NanaTalk
[oml][Anna]
Oooh[Silent...]ow.[.5] Ow[.4] ow[.4] ow.[.4] Please go away[N]
and leave me to die,[.4] I beg of you.[AN]
What?[.4] If you want me to open the[N]
shop before [Red]turn 50[Red],[.4] I'll need [Red]2000[AN]
gold[Red].[.4] Money is a great hangover cure.[A][X]

## NotANumberTalk
[oml][Anna]
Not a prisoner,[.4] I'm a free woman[.5][N]
Live my life the way I want tooooo--[AN]
Oh,[.4] sorry,[.4] did you want something?[.4][N]
You want me to stop listening to[AN]
sweet tunes and open before [Red]turn 70[Red]?[N]
Ok,[.4] but it's gonna cost you [Red]3000 gold[Red].[A][X]

## Unlock_Shop_Choice
Pay to open the shop early?[N]
[No][X]

## Unlock_Shop_Via_Turn
[oml][Anna]
Pssst![.4] I'm going to open this shop![.4][N]
Come on in and spend lots of money![A][X]
## Unlock_Shop_No_Money
[oml][Anna]
Who are you trying to fool?[.4] That's[N]
not the amount of money I asked for![AN]
Come back when you can actually pay![A][X]

## Unlock_Shop_Yes
[oml][Anna]
Oh,[.4] uh,[.4] I didn't actually expect you[N]
to pay up.[.4] Well,[.4] come on in,[.4] and get[AN]
ready for the fleecing of your life[Beat][N]
Oops,[.4] did I say that out loud?[A][X]

## Unlock_Capture1
[oml][Anna]
You know,[.4] these shops aren't the only[N]
place where you pick up cool weapons.[AN]
If you were to hold back your attacks[N]
a bit,[.4] you could capture your enemies[AN]
alive and nick their stuff instead.[AN]
You interested in learning how to do[N]
that?[.4] It'll cost you [Red]2000 gold[Red],[.4] though.[A][X]

## Unlock_Capture2
Take crash course in pillaging?[N]
[No][X]

## Unlock_Capture3
[oml][Anna]
Oh, believe you me.[.4] You won't regret[N]
this.[.4] It's not easy,[.4] though,[.4] so pay[AN]
very close attention to me[Silent...][A][X]

## Unlock_Capture4
You can now capture enemies by[N]
selecting the option from the[N]
action menu, if they fulfill[N]
the following criteria:[AN]
- Enemy must be adjacent.[N]
- Unit's aid > enemy's con.[N]
- Must deal killing blow[N]
with most stats halved.[AN]
Once an enemy has been captured,[N]
they will be rescued and can be[N]
traded with to remove their items.[AN]
You'll also need a free space to[N]
drop them later, unless another[N]
unit can take the burden for you.[N]
Standard rescuing penalties apply.[A][X]

## Unlock_Capture5
[oml][Anna]
Here,[.4] now![.4] I'm not running a[N]
charity![.4] If you don't have[AN]
enough gold now,[.4] come back[N]
later when you can pay.[A][X]

## LightningStrikeText
[oml][Anna]
My word![.4] What just happened?![AN]
[Beat]What?[.4] Indoor lightning?[.4][N]
Surely that can't be natural.[AN]
You'd best be wary;[.4] it[N]
might happen again.[A][X]
