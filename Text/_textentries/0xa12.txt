The horde is surprisingly well-mannered[N]
and will not attack all at once.[AN]
Instead, they will come in waves,[.4][N]
spawning at various points on the map.[AN]
Blocking the spawn points will not work.[AN]
Once a wave has appeared,[.4] they will make[N]
their way to the Duke and attempt to[AN]
politely cave his skull in.[.4] Your job is[N]
to prevent this from happening by[AN]
spawning your own units.[.4] This,[.4] of course,[N]
costs money,[.4] which[Silent...]we don't have.[.4] Hmm.[AN]
I think some negotiations are in order.[A][X]
