[oml][Anna]
Remember how I told you that units can't[N]
move after taking their first action?[AN]
Well,[.4] that's mostly true.[.4] My sister Ana[N]
sells an item called Relocate,[.4] which can[AN]
be used to move a unit somewhere else.[AN]
Also,[.4] classes with the Passable skill,[N]
such as thieves,[.4] are always allowed to[AN]
move a short distance,[.4] but at the[N]
expense of not being able to block enemies.[A][X]
