[oml][Anna]
The story so far is that this chap in[N]
the corner,[.4] Duke Syting of Aliquet,[AN]
has contracted me to save him from[N]
the horde that will be appearing soon.[AN]
I don't remember why, but it doesn't[N]
really matter.[.4] All that matters is[AN]
that I'm getting paid, and you are[N]
going to help me achieve that goal.[AN]
Well,[.4] there's no time to lose.[.4] Let's go![A][X]
