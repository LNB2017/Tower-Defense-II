[oml][Anna]
Have you bought a dancer yet?[.4] They're[N]
expensive,[.4] but the Dance ability has[AN]
been upgraded;[.4] it will now refresh all[N]
adjacent units at once.[.4] Neat, huh?[AN]
They also come with a random ring,[.4][N]
which buffs a single target and[AN]
refreshes them at the same time.[A][X]
