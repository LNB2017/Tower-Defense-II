[omr][Anna]
Look![.4] A wave has spawned.[.4] Nothing too[N]
threatening yet,[.4] but that will change.[AN]
Enemies will move towards the Duke,[.4][N]
provided there is an open path.[AN]
If there isn't,[.4] however,[.4] they will[N]
try to attack anything in range![AN]
The goal box shows when the next wave[N]
will spawn,[.4] but not where,[.4] so watch out![A][X]
