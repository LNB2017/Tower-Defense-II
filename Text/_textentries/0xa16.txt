[oml][Anna]
When you buy a unit,[.4] a random[N]
character is then picked as well.[AN]
There are 100 different characters,[.4][N]
and each comes with a unique[AN]
combination of personal skill,[.4][N]
base modifiers,[.4] and growth modifiers.[AN]
The latter two are added to class[N]
bases and class growths,[.4] respectively.[AN]
This means that two units of the[N]
same class won't necessarily level[AN]
up in the same way,[.4] but I think[N]
that's part of the fun![AN]
You can check growths by pressing[N]
Select on the stat screen.[A][X]
