[oml][Anna]

When you buy a unit,[.4] a random[N]

character is then picked as well.[AN]

There are 100 different characters,[.4][N]

and each comes with a unique[AN]

combination of personal skill,[.4][N]

base modifiers,[.4] and growth modifiers.[AN]

The latter two are added to class[N]

bases and class growths,[.4] respectively.[AN]

This means that two units of the[N]

same class won't necessarily level[AN]

up in the same way,[.4] but I think[N]

that's part of the fun![AN]

You can check growths by pressing[N]

Select on the stat screen.[A][X]
