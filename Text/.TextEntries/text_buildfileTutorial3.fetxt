[omr][Anna]

Look![.4] A wave has spawned.[.4] Nothing too[N]

threatening yet,[.4] but that will change.[AN]

Enemies will move towards the Duke,[.4][N]

provided there is an open path.[AN]

If there isn't,[.4] however,[.4] they will[N]

try to attack anything in range![AN]

The goal box shows when the next wave[N]

will spawn,[.4] but not where,[.4] so watch out![A][X]
