[oml][Anna]

Remember how I told you that units can't[N]

move after taking their first action?[AN]

Well,[.4] that's mostly true.[.4] My sister Ana[N]

sells an item called Relocate,[.4] which can[AN]

be used to move a unit somewhere else.[AN]

Also,[.4] classes with the Passable skill,[N]

such as thieves,[.4] are always allowed to[AN]

move a short distance,[.4] but at the[N]

expense of not being able to block enemies.[A][X]
