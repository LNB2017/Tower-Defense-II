Have you bought a dancer yet?[.4] They're[N]

expensive,[.4] but the Dance ability has[AN]

been upgraded;[.4] it will now refresh all[N]

adjacent units at once.[.4] Neat, huh?[AN]

They also come with a random ring,[.4][N]

which buffs a single target and[AN]

refreshes them at the same time.[A][X]
