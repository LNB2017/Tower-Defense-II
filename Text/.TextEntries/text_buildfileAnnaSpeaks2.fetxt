[oml][Anna]

The story so far is that this chap in[N]

the corner,[.4] Duke Syting of Aliquet,[AN]

has contracted me to save him from[N]

the horde that will be appearing soon.[AN]

I don't remember why, but it doesn't[N]

really matter.[.4] All that matters is[AN]

that I'm getting paid, and you are[N]

going to help me achieve that goal.[AN]

Well,[.4] there's no time to lose.[.4] Let's go![A][X]
