The horde is surprisingly well-mannered[N]

and will not attack all at once.[AN]

Instead, they will come in waves,[.4][N]

spawning at various points on the map.[AN]

Blocking the spawn points will not work.[AN]

Once a wave has appeared,[.4] they will make[N]

their way to the Duke and attempt to[AN]

politely cave his skull in.[.4] Your job is[N]

to prevent this from happening by[AN]

spawning your own units.[.4] This,[.4] of course,[N]

costs money,[.4] which[Silent...]we don't have.[.4] Hmm.[AN]

I think some negotiations are in order.[A][X]
