[oml][Anna]

Summoners are a versatile unit that can[N]

either heal or attack,[.4] depending on what[AN]

class they promoted from,[.4] but both[N]

versions can summon phantoms to the field.[AN]

A phantom comes with a random weapon[N]

and cannot trade or use Supply,[.4] but[AN]

they're great options for chipping away[N]

at tough opponents.[.4] There can be up to[AN]

5 phantoms active at one time between[N]

all summoners on the field.[A][X]
